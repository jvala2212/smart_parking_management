# smart_parking_management
Developing a smart parking management system using machine learning involves leveraging data and algorithms to optimize parking space usage, predict parking availability, and enhance the overall efficiency of the parking facility. 
In our urban environments, the proliferation of vehicles has outpaced the development of available parking spaces, underscoring the increasing relevance of services that provide information about parking availability for effective urban mobility management. Drivers often spend a significant amount of time searching for vacant parking lots, leading to frustration, increased costs, and environmental pollution, particularly during peak hours and in specific urban areas like hospitals, stations, parks, and sports stadiums. The search for available parking spaces is influenced by various factors, including travel motivations, garage proximity to the destination, price variations among garages, and unfamiliarity with the selected urban area.

This quest for parking not only inconveniences and frustrates drivers but also imposes a substantial negative impact on the efficiency of the transportation system within the urban fabric and on overall sustainability. The search for parking contributes to unnecessary traffic congestion and environmental degradation due to heightened vehicle emissions. These challenges are not exclusive to parking garages with gates; they can experience high occupancy in specific areas and timeframes, leading to unexpected fullness conditions. Real-time parking information, such as capacity, garage prices, and the number of available parking slots, has been collected for some time, enabling the development of statistical predictive models.

This paper explores a solution for predicting the number of available parking slots in parking garages with gates, considering two different types: those with a regular and easily predictable service and those dealing with strongly randomized cases. The proposed prediction model is robust in critical scenarios, such as when the number of free slots approaches zero or when data are missing in the stream. The model is developed within the context of an IoT-based smart parking project, leveraging a blockchain-based architecture. The use of open data and real-time data within the Downtown of San Jose areas aligns with the current Smart City solution. The following section delves into related works to provide a comprehensive contextualization of the research topic, followed by an overview of the paper's structure and a detailed description of the proposed solution.
# Problem statement 
Ineffective parking management is an important factor in traffic jams and pollution in a rapid urbanization cities
The challenge lies in developing a machine learning-driven smart parking solution that optimizes parking space utilization, reduces search time for parking, lowers carbon emissions, and enhances the overall urban living experience
